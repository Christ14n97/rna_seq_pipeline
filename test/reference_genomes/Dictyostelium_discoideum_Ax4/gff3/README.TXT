The GFF3 files distributed by dictyBase are still in the Beta stages and are subject to change.  Please send us feedback if you are using these files.  All feedback will be responded to and appreciated.  The date that a given GFF file is generated is noted in the file itself on a comment line.


Each chromosome is written to its own GFF3 file and the full chromosome sequence is included in the file.
